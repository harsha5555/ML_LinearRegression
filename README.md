Implementing Linear Regression

LINEAR REGRESSION: The objective of a linear regression model is to find a relationship between one or more features(independent variables) and a continuous target variable(dependent variable). When there is only feature it is called Uni-variate Linear Regression and if there are multiple features, it is called Multiple Linear Regression.

EQUATION : Y = θ₀ + θ₁x₁ +...+ θₙxₙ
